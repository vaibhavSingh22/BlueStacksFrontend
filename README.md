This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Changing Language 

You can change Language by Clicking the button in Navbar. Localisation support is provided using React Context API.

## Changing Campaign 

You can change the Date for campaigns by clicking on Schedule Again link. This opens a calender and the date value can be selected from there. Changing Date value also moves the Campaign to appropriate Tab.
